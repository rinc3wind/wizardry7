In this file you will find description of all available patches that *Cosmic Forge* allows for
W6 & W7.

1. Change attribute bonus generation algorithm.
===============================================

This is a cheating patch: it makes the probability of creation a powerful character to soar greatly.

The original algorithm both for W6 & W7 is as follows:

	Character gets						1d6+4	bonus points (5-10)
	If what the character got is less than 9
		(S)He gets					1d4+7	bonus points (8-11)	2/3
	Otherwise
		It is 1/20 that (s)he may gain additional	+8	bonus points (13-18)	1/60
		It is 1/20 that (s)he may gain additional	+8	bonus points (21-26)	1/1200
	End
	
	(8-11)	2/3
	(5-10)	1179/1200
	(13-18)	20/1200
	(21-26)	1/1200

The patched algorithm both for W6 & W7 is as follows:

	Character gets						1d19+7	bonus points (8-26)
	If what the character got is less than 9
		(S)He gets					1d4+7	bonus points (8-11)	1/19
	End

The fix is reversible.



2. Remove 'Swings per attack' restriction for Shoot and Throw attacks.
======================================================================

This is a cheating patch: it modifies the game logic (in this case the combat logic).

The base logic of the game concerning this matter is that when the attack type of the monster or
one of your characters is either 'Throw' or 'Shoot' type, than 'Swings per attack' is defaulting to 1.

The patch removes that restriction, so in that case the monster or one of your characters can 'Shoot'
or 'Throw' more than once per attack (providing that (s)he has 'Swings per attack' > 1). Thus the patch
rejuvenates projectile and throwing weaponry.

But there are several flaws in this patch:
a. Your character will lose only one missile from its inventory regardless of the number of shots made
   per attack (that is the cheating part).
b. Animation for the missile will be drawn once (does not really matters).
c. Some monsters will become VERY powerful, notably ROBOTS. ROBOTS have powerful enough weapons such as
   LASER CANNON, PLASMA CANNON and SPECTRAL RAY which hurts badly the whole party. In the unpatched game
   they will only shoot that once per attack, in the patched version they may (and will) shoot it more than
   once.



3. 'Slaying Weapons Bug' and 'Monster Slaying Ability Bug' (For W7 only).
==========================================================================

Those fixes simply modify game database and are not cheats.

Basically, every creature of 'Fighter' type (yes, some monsters are fighters) in the game takes double damage
from almost every weapon. This applies to your party fighters as well.

The patches simply fix that issue. One is made to remove unfair double damage dealing to your fighters. Another
is made to remove unfair double dealing to monsters.




4. 'Resting' algorithm.
==========================================================================

Everybody agree that resting in original game is boring, annoying, useless and so on. The only parameter that gets recovered well is stamina. HP and Mana regenerate VERY VERY slowly.
The fix changes that a bit:

The original algorithm is as follows:
	Character recovers
		STAMINA:	(1d5 + 5)% of Stamina				per 1 game hour of resting
		HP:		1d2-1						per 1 game hour of resting
		MANA:		1d[SphereRegenValue + 1]-1			per 1 game hour of resting

The new algorithm is as follows:
	Character recovers
		STAMINA:	(1d[VITALITY/2] + VITALITY/2)% of Stamina	per 1 game hour of resting in GOLD and per 30 game minutes in W7 DOS
		HP:		VITALITY					per 30 game minutes of resting
		MANA:		SphereRegenValue + 1				per 10 game minutes of resting

Also a strange check is disabled that sometimes prevents HP regeneration during the rest. Probably it bears some meaning but I could not understand it.

In other words if your character has VITALITY 18 and Mana Regeneration 2 in one of the Magic Spheres, then after 8 hours of rest (full uninterrupted rest) he will gain:
	64/76/88/100/112/124				Percent of Stamina (Having VITALITY 10/12/14/16/18/20) (Double that for W7 DOS)
	160/192/224/256/288/320				HP (Having VITALITY 10/12/14/16/18/20)
	96/144/192/240/288/336				Mana (Having Mana Regeneration 1/2/3/4/5/6 in the corresponding Magic Sphere) (Divide by 6 for W6)
instead of:
	64						Percent of Stamina (Regardless of anything)
	0 to 8 (average 4)				HP (Regardless of anything)
	0 to 8/16/24/32/40/48 (average 4/8/12/16/20/24)	Mana (Having Mana Regeneration 1/2/3/4/5/6 in the corresponding Magic Sphere)

The fix is reversible.
